## 1. Introduction/Overview

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Review authenticity**: Should there be additional verification beyond booking confirmation to prevent fake reviews?
2. **Negative review handling**: What support should be provided to landlords receiving poor reviews?
3. **Review aggregation**: Should room and landlord ratings be combined into an overall property score?
