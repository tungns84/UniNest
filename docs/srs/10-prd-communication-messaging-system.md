2. **Facilitate coordination**: Support room inquiries, booking coordination, and check-in arrangements
3. **Build relationships**: Foster trust and communication between platform participants
4. **Maintain privacy**: Ensure conversations remain private between participants
5. **Prevent spam**: Implement basic filtering to maintain communication quality

## 3. User Stories

**As a user**, I want to message landlords about their room listings so that I can ask questions and get additional information before booking.

**As a landlord**, I want to initiate conversations with potential tenants so that I can provide proactive information and build relationships.

**As a landlord**, I want to share photos of my property so that I can provide additional visual information to interested users.

**As a user**, I want to see when landlords were last active so that I can understand their responsiveness and availability.

**As any user**, I want my conversations to remain private so that I can communicate freely without privacy concerns.

**As a platform participant**, I want to be protected from spam messages so that I can focus on legitimate accommodation discussions.
