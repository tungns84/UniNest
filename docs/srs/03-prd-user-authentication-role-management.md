# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## User Authentication and Role Management System

---

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The User Authentication and Role Management System is the security foundation of the room rental platform that manages user accounts, access permissions, and role-based functionality. This system enables secure user registration, login, and appropriate access control for students, landlords, university officials, and system administrators while maintaining simplicity and ease of use for the MVP launch.

**Goal:** Provide a secure, user-friendly authentication system that supports multiple user types with appropriate permissions while maintaining simplicity for quick user onboarding and platform adoption.

---

## 2. Goals

1. **Secure access control**: Ensure only authorized users can access platform features appropriate to their role
2. **Streamlined onboarding**: Enable users to register and start using the platform within 5 minutes
3. **Role-based functionality**: Provide appropriate features and permissions based on user type
4. **Account security**: Protect user accounts with basic security measures and easy recovery options
5. **Scalable architecture**: Design system to support platform growth and additional user types

---

## 3. User Stories

**As a student/exam candidate**, I want to register with my email and basic information so that I can search for accommodation and contact landlords.

**As a landlord**, I want to create an account with my contact details so that I can post room listings and manage my properties.

**As a university official**, I want to register with my institutional email so that I can manage exam sessions and university information.

**As a system administrator**, I want to have full access to all platform features so that I can manage users, verify listings, and maintain system operations.

**As any user**, I want to easily reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account.

**As any user**, I want to update my profile information so that I can keep my account details current.

---

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Simple password-based auth only for MVP
- **Social media login**: No Google, Facebook, or other social login integration
- **Advanced permission systems**: No custom roles or granular permission management
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: No integration with external authentication providers
- **Identity verification**: No government ID or document verification requirements

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 User Interface Design
- **Mobile-first**: Registration and login optimized for Android app and mobile web
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show role-specific fields only after user type selection
- **Clear feedback**: Immediate validation messages and success/error states
- **Accessibility**: Form labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility

### 6.2 Security Considerations
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation for all user inputs

- **User table**: Core user information with role designation and status fields
- **User profile table**: Extended profile information specific to user types
- **Session table**: Active session management with expiration tracking
- **Verification table**: Email/phone verification tokens and status
- **Audit log table**: Security events and profile changes

### 7.2 API Design
- **Authentication endpoints**: `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`
- **Password management**: `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`, `POST /api/auth/reset-password`
- **Profile management**: `GET/PUT /api/user/profile`, `PUT /api/user/change-password`
- **Verification**: `POST /api/auth/verify-email`, `POST /api/auth/resend-verification`
- **Admin endpoints**: `GET /api/admin/users`, `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/role`

### 7.3 Security Implementation
