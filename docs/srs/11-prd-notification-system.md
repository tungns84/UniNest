## 2. Goals

1. **Keep users informed**: Deliver immediate notifications for critical platform events
2. **Maintain simplicity**: Provide basic notification functionality without complex controls
3. **Ensure reliability**: Guarantee delivery of important notifications within the app
4. **Prevent notification overload**: Focus on essential notifications only
5. **Maintain clean interface**: Auto-dismiss notifications to keep the interface uncluttered

## 3. User Stories

**As a user**, I want to receive immediate notifications about my bookings so that I stay informed about confirmation, check-in reminders, and status changes.

**As a landlord**, I want to be notified when I receive new messages so that I can respond promptly to potential tenants.

**As any user**, I want to receive system update notifications so that I'm aware of important platform changes or maintenance.

**As a user**, I want simple control over notifications so that I can turn them off if needed without complex configuration.

**As any user**, I want old notifications to be automatically cleaned up so that my notification area doesn't become cluttered.

**As a platform participant**, I want notifications to be delivered reliably so that I don't miss important information.
